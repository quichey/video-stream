Goals for this branch list-comments-api

- get a "good" api up that will facilitate infinite scroll of comments
on the client computers
- read up on Flask docs to fully understand the powers and limitations of the 
framework as well as learn web-app standards/protocols along the way

may need to restructure some folders to better follow certain standards/guidelines

the API needs to be able to page through the comments Table
params? 
- page_size (limit?)
- page_number (token? next_page_token?)

the API seems to need to be a POST request to accept the params in an easy manner
Why did I not do query string params?
I'm not sure. naming the routes seems kinda weird. Maybe I should analyze the youtube
http requests.


Where to have SQL_ALchemy data_fetching code/utils
- db folder?
- api folder?

- could have a third utils folder
----- but shouldn't sqlalchemy be kind of be the same thing? a downloaded library/folder with utility functions?
----- i'm pretty sure, I think should do away with that

-- I think just add in a file in api folder where it imports from db/DB_SCHEMA and do other things?



# TODO:
--- update pyproject.toml
