wishlist:

one single deploy.sh script to run to deploy client and server
handle both local and cloud OS(s)
set up .bashrc
handle the interactive delays of cloud run
emulate Object-Oriented-Programming Paradigm w/mixins
file-structure:

common/
common/setup.sh
common/build.sh
common/run.sh
util/
client/
client/setup.sh
client/build.sh
client/run.sh
server/
server/setup.sh
server/build.sh
server/run.sh
deploy.sh
Communcates with:

cloud/Docker/
client/
server/

Got it! Here’s a detailed plan and a prototype of how you could implement your deploy.sh with OOP-style scripting using bash mixins, plus the file structure and sample contents for your common/, util/, client/, and server/ scripts.

1. File Structure:
arduino
Copy
Edit
deploy.sh
common/
  setup.sh
  build.sh
  run.sh
util/
client/
  setup.sh
  build.sh
  run.sh
server/
  setup.sh
  build.sh
  run.sh
cloud/
  Docker/
    ...
client/
  ...
server/
  ...
2. Core idea:
common/*.sh defines base functions (e.g., generic setup(), build(), run(), and helpers like log(), detect_os(), set_bashrc() etc.)

client/*.sh and server/*.sh source those and override or extend the base functions to implement client/server specifics — emulating OOP mixins in bash.

deploy.sh sources both client and server scripts and calls their workflows sequentially or in parallel.

Includes OS detection, .bashrc setup, and handles cloud interactive stuff.

3. Example Contents
common/setup.sh

#!/usr/bin/env bash

    Darwin*)    OS=macos;;
    *)          OS=unknown;;
  esac
  echo "$OS"
}

set_bashrc() {
  log "Setting up .bashrc"
  # Example: add some env vars or aliases if missing
  if ! grep -q "DEPLOY_ENV" ~/.bashrc; then
    echo 'export DEPLOY_ENV=local' >> ~/.bashrc
    log "Added DEPLOY_ENV to ~/.bashrc"
  fi

client_setup() { setup; }
client_build() { build; }
client_run() { run; }

server_setup() { setup; }

# Because of sourcing and naming conflicts, just call functions directly:
client_setup() {
  echo "Running client setup..."
  setup
}
client_build() {
  echo "Running client build..."
  build
}
client_run() {
  echo "Running client run..."
  run

  setup
}
server_build() {
  echo "Running server build..."
  build
}
server_run() {
  echo "Running server run..."
  run
}

main "$@"
5. Notes & To-Do
You’ll want to rename the setup, build, run functions in each client/server script to e.g. client_setup, client_build, etc., or better yet use namespaces by file sourcing order so the functions don’t conflict.

Alternatively, source with different variable/function names or use bash associative arrays for state.

This is a prototype to get you started; you can refine function naming, add flags, and extend with cloud-specific logic (like gcloud builds submit or skipping prompts).

You can add command line argument parsing to deploy.sh to support ./deploy.sh client or ./deploy.sh server etc.

Cloud shell interactivity can be bypassed with flags in scripts (--quiet, --no-interaction) and expect scripts.

If you'd like, I can help you refine this further, including adding real function namespacing or dealing with interactive prompts in cloud environments!

How do you want to proceed?
