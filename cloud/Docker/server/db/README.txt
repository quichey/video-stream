I think can use Google Cloud Run/build
to launch mysql db just to get a DNS domain name for it 
that is publicly available. Though should have restricted access.
I recall an option after running the Run script to make 
it restricted access.

So maybe have a similar setup.sh in this folder to scriptify
the build/deploy process into google cloud
