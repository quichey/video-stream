# using google cloud
# and probably docker

# Trying to launch public Web-app on Google cloud
# started out with local development
# Trying to understand the Google Cloud Run/Docker Tutorial
# To Integrate the service into my existing local file-structure/program

# I usually see DockerFiles in the same folder as the sub-service
# However, I would like to encapsulate the Cloud-Architecture
# as much as possible
# to align with my own understanding of Web Software
### plan is to modify the scripts from the monolith tutorial repo 
### so that DockerFiles in the cloud/Docker subdir get loaded into
### necessary micro-services


# Opening up sub-branch as other branch is at a good state of tangible progress
## DO NOT want tinkering w/server cloud code to mess up other things
