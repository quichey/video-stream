This is a work in progess. Keep on remembering different ideas/concepts from
Work as well as Schooling.

For now, interested in minimizing dependencies on other packages.
Trying to format folders/code to lend its way to high scalability.

First large feature I intend to get up is Infinite Scroll of comments
on a "Youtube" like video.

I do not have too much creativity in terms of "creating" new things.
I am more interested in analyzing existing technologies and 
learning how to replicate them.
I use Youtube often, so I hope to be able to 
replicate much of Youtube functionality, but also reduce 
the scope enough to have a working demo for Job-Apps.

Current Architecture(?) is python for server-side and React-javascript for client-side.
Reasoning? Mainly a lot of experience at previous two companies working in these languages.
Considered doing only one language for both server/client, but python seems more 
suited to operability between different Operating Systems. And Javascript is the core
language of most Web-Apps.

Hope to get an official Publicly Available Website up, but unsure if I will get to
that point.
