## 🧑‍💻 Development Notes

This project is an ongoing **learning + demo app**, where I replicate and analyze existing large-scale web technologies like YouTube.  
- Started with **comment infinite scroll** as the first large feature.  
- Working on **video storage schemas** for scalability.  
- Exploring session management for both **logged-in** and **anonymous users**.  

For deeper design notes and brainstorming, see [DEV_NOTES.md](./DEV_NOTES.md).

## 🚦 Next Steps

- Add **user registration + channels**  
- Implement **recommendations**  
- Support **playlists & search**  
- Optimize **video storage & retrieval**
